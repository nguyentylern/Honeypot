                <p>Online, you are under constant oversight from the websites that you visit. These websites collect information about you like your time zone, operating system, browser settings and extensions, and other pieces of information in the form of cookies. These pieces are information are often spread around to track you. As a result, it is very difficult to escape your past on the internet.</p>
                <p>Here are some findings from research about your digital privacy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It would take an average person 244 hours per year to read all the privacy policies of the websites they visit (McDonald & Cranor, 2008).</li>
                    <li>Privacy policies from 75 different websites were analyzed and found that the policies were often long, complex, and difficult to read. The policies used technical and legal language that was not easily understandable to the average person. (McDonald & Cranor, 2008).</li>
                    <li>Many developers collect more data than necessary for the app's functionality, with some apps collecting more than 10 times the amount of data required. (Balebako et al., 2018).</li>
                    <li>Another concerning finding was that many developers used insecure data storage methods, such as storing data in plain text, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to user data. (Balebako et al., 2018).</li>
