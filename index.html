                    <h2>Your privacy matters.</h2>
                    <p>The relationship between you and the internet can have impacts on your health. This is a well-known phenomena that is often exemplified by the effects of social media on mental health such as increased stress and correlations to other mental conditions. Relating to online privacy, there is limited literature that introduces ideas that the loss of privacy online negatively impacts mental health. Ethically (as well), there are issues relating to personal security when it comes to online privacy and how your data is handled by online services; some being the selling of information and the targetting of advertisements.</p>

                    <h2>Websites<br>track you.</h2>
                    <p>When ever you go to a website, it requests information from you. In doing so, data about yourself is being given up. For example, a music streaming statistics service is a direct form of data collection; but on the other hand, going to a website like Facebook or Amazon automatically takes the information to track you. Often, this information is used to deliver advertisements that fir your interests to you.</p>

                <h2>How do you protect your privacy?</h2>
                <p>There are various methods that you can use to protect yourself online; however, they are not going to completely eliminate the possibility of invasions into your privacy. Some include preventing yourself from joining services by reading privacy policies; while reading these policies there are things to look out for while deciding to join. Other methods are typically changing parts of your online behavior such as how you manage passwords, cookies, and advertisements.</p>

                <p>Honeypot is a website project by three students at Innovation Academy in Alpharetta, Georgia. Spurred by a prompt about user data collection, we decided to create this website to inform people about their privacy online, as we believe it to be an important ethical issue.</p>
